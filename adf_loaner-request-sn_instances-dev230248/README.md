## ServiceNow Studio and Tools

- **ServiceNow Studio**: This is where the application was built, managed, and extended. The platformâ€™s core features, like **Client Scripts**, **Business Rules**, and **UI Actions**, were leveraged to ensure smooth functionality.
  
  - **Client Scripts**: JavaScript that runs in the browser, used to control field validation and behavior.
  - **UI Actions**: Custom buttons for form actions (e.g., submit, approve).
  - **UI Policies**: Manage field behavior, such as making fields required or visible under certain conditions.
  - **Business Rules**: Automates back-end processes, ensuring that data is processed correctly.
  - **Flow Designer**: A visual tool to create workflows, handling the routing and approval processes for requests.

## Features and Concepts

### 1. Client Scripts
- **Purpose**: To control the form behavior and validate user input.
- **Example**: If the user selects a "Laptop" item, the "Serial Number" field becomes mandatory.

### 2. UI Actions
- **Purpose**: Adds buttons or other actions on forms for user interaction.
- **Example**: A "Submit Request" button that triggers the workflow.

### 3. UI Policies
- **Purpose**: Enforces rules on forms, such as making fields visible or read-only based on conditions.
- **Example**: For high-value items, additional approval fields are required.

### 4. Business Rules
- **Purpose**: Server-side automation for data processing.
- **Example**: Automatically update the status of a request to "Pending Approval" when it's submitted.

### 5. Flow Designer
- **Purpose**: Automates workflows for processes like approval, assignment, and notifications.
- **Example**: A flow that routes loan requests through multiple approval stages based on the value of the item.
